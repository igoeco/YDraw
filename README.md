## Note - Windows10 WinTab update
The latest Windows 10 update breaks JPen's ability to acquire pressure sensitivity information from the Windows Tablet driver. You will need to install this WinTab driver update ([Wintab_x64_1.0.0.20.zip](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498)) to restore pressure sensitivity. Without this update the pen will loose it smoothness.
