<p>YDraw is a free Drawing software authored by Ramesh Yerraballi.

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Download and Unzip <a href="https://github.com/igoeco/YDraw/archive/master.zip">YDraw-master.zip</a> to any location. I suggest you unzip it to a folder called YDraw. YDraw will work on any system that has java 1.6 or later. All you need is a <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">java runtime</a> (from Oracle). The software is in the YDrawTool directory. You will find an executable jar file called YDraw.jar there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a id="information" class="anchor" href="#information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What is YDraw?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YDraw is a simple drawing software that can be used on a PC with a Touchscreen or a Mac with a Wacom tablet.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why YDraw?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several drawing tools for Tablet computers and Wacom external tablets but they all have cumbersome GUIs that come in the way of writing. For example, if one wants to change the color of the pen one has to open a menu, scroll through it and pick the color. All this comes in the way and is captured if you are making a screencast. All YDraw options are keyboard shortcuts.   </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="running" class="anchor" href="#running" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you have the java runtime installed just double-click on the <u><tt>YDraw.jar</tt></u> file inside the YDrawTool directory that you unzipped in the previous step.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Note that all features in YDraw are accessible using keyboard
shortcuts. So, all you will see is a blank screen when you run the
jar. Nothing you checkpoint is ever lost as all sessions are
automatically saved under the <u><tt>Saves</tt></u> folder where
YDrawTool was installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What/where are the options?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of options. Type <b><tt>Ctrl+h</tt></b> to find out.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Use cases and Features:</p></li>
<ul>
<li>
<u><em>The properties file</em></u>: There are a few customizable settings that one can set. You can configure these settings in the <u><tt>YDraw.properties</tt></u> file.
</li>
<li>
  <u><em>Hotkeys </em></u>:
  <ul>
    <li> <u><em> Thickness </em></u> - To change the thichness of the pen you can
either choose from four preset thickness
(extra<u><tt>f</tt></u>ine, <u><tt>F</tt></u>ine, <u><tt>t</tt></u>hick
and extra<u><tt>T</tt></u>hick). Alternatively, you can use
the <tt>up</tt> and <tt>down</tt> arrow keys to change the thickness
of the pen at a finer granularity. </li>

<li><u> <em> Color </em></u> - The color hotkeys are as
follows: <u><tt>b</tt></u>lue (default), <u><tt>w</tt></u>hite,
Blac<u><tt>k</tt></u>, <u><tt>r</tt></u>ed, <u><tt>g</tt></u>reen, <u><tt>m</tt></u>agenta, <u><tt>o</tt></u>range. ma<u><tt>R</tt></u>oon, <u><tt>c</tt></u>yan, <u><tt>y</tt></u>ellow, <u><tt>o</tt></u>range. Try
	 the <u><tt>a</tt></u> key for a random color. Also, uppercase on these hotkeys gives a darker version of the same color</li>
<li><u> <em> Eraser - </em></u> The eraser can be engaged several ways, the simplest way is to use the top end of the stylus. Alternatively, you can press the button on the stylus while you write. If you want to use it continuously then simple use the hotkey <u><tt>e</tt></u>rase </li>
    <li><u> <em> dashed line </em></u> - Use the <u><tt>d</tt></u>ash hotkey if you want your lines to be dashes. </li>
    <li><u> <em> Highlighter </em></u> - Use the <b><tt>Ctrl+m</tt></b> hotkey to mark things using a highlighter. The color of the highligher can be configured in the properties file.</li>
  </ul>	 
		      
<li>
<u><em>Recording a session</em></u>: The notion of a session is screenshots
taken at key points in ones narrative which can then be saved. At points
where one has covered something of substance and may move to a
different concept one can save a checkpoint (<b><tt>Ctrl+p</tt></b>). One can navigate through
the checkpoints using (<b><tt>Ctrl+r</tt></b> or <b><tt>Ctrl+left</tt></b> to rewind and <b><tt>Ctrl+f</tt></b> or
<b><tt>Ctrl+right</tt></b> to forward). When you are done, you can save all the
checkpoints by using <b><tt>Ctrl+x</tt></b> to quit, which saves all the checkpoints
as png files and creates a PDF document. The png files are higher
quality than the PDF document.

<u><em>Resuming a session</em></u>: One can preload a previous session
using <b><tt>Ctrl+l</tt></b>. You do this if you want to review what you covered in the
previous session and/or use that as a starting point for the current
session.</li>

<li>
<u><em>Cut-and-paste from Clipboard</em></u>: Anything in the clipboard (text
or images) can be brought into YDraw by using <b><tt>Ctrl+v</tt></b> as you do in any
other application. So, if you cut some text in say a document then you
can paste it in YDraw. If the font is too small, undo the paste (<b><tt>Ctrl+z</tt></b>) and
then use the right arrow key to make the font bigger and paste
again. If you paste a image then you can scale it up or down using the
">" or "<" key (no need to undo the paste).</li>
	   
<li>
<u><em>Grab content from YDraw</em></u>: To grab content from YDraw
use <b><tt>Ctrl+g</tt></b> and then choose the rectangular region you
want to grab (a gray outline will show you that that region has been
copied. You now have that region in your Clipboard. You can paste it
if any application that allows you to paste (<b><tt>Ctrl+v</tt></b>)an
image from the clipboard. </li>

<li>
<u><em>Image Presets</em></u>:  You can pre-populate Ydraw with up to 10
images that can then be imported into YDraw with a single key(number
0-9). The images you want to preset have to be stored in
the <u><tt>images</tt></u> directory in the YDrawtool folder. The
image files can be gif, png or jpg, named in lexical order. The lower
named file gets assigned the lower number hotkey with the lowest one
getting hotkey 0. The import always happens where the cursor is
currently located. If you disable the mouse then the pen position is
the cursor position. If you don't like where the import occurred then
simply undo (<b><tt>Ctrl+z</tt></b>) the paste and move the cursor
where you want the import and press the number hotkey again.</li>

<li>
<u><em>Using as a Glass</em></u>: If you have some other application
under YDraw that you'd like to draw on. You can engage the YDraw glass
feature using <b><tt>Ctrl+t</tt></b> which makes YDraw
transparent. You can then take a snapshot of the screen, which will be
the appication snapshot. Now disable the glass feature by
using <b><tt>Ctrl+t</tt></b> again. Now you can go back to the last
snapshot using <b><tt>Ctrl+r</tt></b> (rewind) and start writing on
it. Also, when you are in the "glass" feature you can change the
transparency of YDraw by using <b><tt>PgUp</tt></b>
and <b><tt>PgDn</tt></b> keys. Use this to annotate directly on the
bottom application (of course you can still take a snapshot of that)
Another neat thing you can do with the glass feature is to grab just
section of the bottom application. For example if there is
code(insides an IDE or browser etc.) you want to import into YDraw
with its color scheme in place use Ctrl+t followed by Ctrl+g and you
have the section in your clipboard.
</li>
<li>
<u><em>Quit or Exit </em></u>: There are two ways the terminate your session.
Use <b><tt>Ctrl+q</tt></b> if you want to quit without saving
explicitly. Note that all sessions (individual snapshots) are still
auto-saved in the saves folder. To end a session and have a PDF
document of the session, use <b><tt>Ctrl+x</tt></b>, which prompts you
for a destination folder to save your session in.</li>

<li>
<u><em>The Khan Academy mode</em></u>: If you are presenting in a room that
has too much light you can use the reverse video mode akin to the
mode used by Salman Khan in his Khan Academy videos. Engage this mode
using <b><tt>Ctrl+b</tt></b>. I like using this mode when I am
recording a screencast</li>

<li>
<u><em>One screenshot</em></u>: To save a single screenshot to a destination
folder use <b><tt>Ctrl+s</tt></b>. I use this during my office hours
to explain something to a student and then mail the screenshot to
her.</li>
