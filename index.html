<p>YDraw is a free Drawing software authored by Ramesh Yerraballi.

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Download and Unzip <a href="https://github.com/igoeco/YDraw/archive/master.zip">YDraw-master.zip</a> to any location. I suggest you unzip it to a folder called YDraw. YDraw will work on any system that has java 1.6 or later. All you need is a java runtime (from Oracle). The crux of the software is in the YDrawTool directory. You will find an executable jar file called YDraw.jar there.</p>
</blockquote>

<a id="information" class="anchor" href="#information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What is YDraw?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YDraw is a simple drawing software that can be used on a PC with a Touchscreen or a Mac with a Wacom tablet.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why YDraw?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several drawing tools for Tablet computers and Wacom external tablets but they all have cumbersome GUIs that come in the way of writing. For example, if one wants to change the color of the pen one has to open a menu, scroll through it and pick the color. All this comes in the way and is captured if you are making a screencast. All YDraw options are keyboard shortcuts.   </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="running" class="anchor" href="#running" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you have the java runtime installed just double-click on the YDraw.jar file inside the YDrawTool directory that you unzipped in the previous step.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Note that all features in YDraw are accessible using keyboard shortcuts. So, all you will see is a blank screen when you run the jar. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What/where are the options?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are lot of options. Type Ctrl+h to find out. Detailed documentation of all features and example uses is forthcoming.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Use cases and Features:</p></li>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The properties file</em>: There are a few customizable settings that one can set. You can configure these settings in the <u>YDraw.properties</u> file.
<li>
<em>One screenshot</em>: Draw/write what you want using/switching the pen color as you go. There is an eraser (key e) and different pen thickness to choose from including a dashed line option. To save a screenshot use Ctrl+s. I use this during my office hours to explain something to a student.</li>

<li>
<em>Recording a session</em>: My idea of a session is screenshots taken at key points in my narrative which can then be saved. At points where I think I covered something of substance and may move to a different concept I save a checkpoint (ctrl+p). I can rewind through the checkpoints using  (Ctrl+f to forward). When I am done, I will save all the checkpoints by using Ctrl+x to quit, which saves all the checkpoints as png files and creates a PDF document. The png files are higher quality than the PDF document. You can preload a previous session using ctrl+l. I do this if I want to review what I covered in the previous session and/or use that as a starting point for the current session.</li>
